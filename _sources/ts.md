# ⏱️ Time Series vs. 📌 Timestamped Data

---

## 🔎 What is Time Series?

A **time series** is a sequence of data points ordered by time.

* ⏩ Each observation depends on the past (temporal dependency).
* 📈 Patterns like **trends**, **seasonality**, or **cycles** often appear.
* 🔮 The goal is usually **forecasting the future** from historical data.

👉 *Example:* Forecasting tomorrow’s electricity demand using the past year of hourly data.

## 📌 What is Timestamped Data?

**Timestamped data** is any dataset where each record has a time attached.

* ✅ The timestamp tells you *when* something happened.
* ❌ But values may not depend on each other in sequence.
* Focus is often on **logging events** or **detecting anomalies**, not forecasting.

👉 *Example:* A smart meter records usage every minute — each value is independent unless you structure them into a time series.

## ⚡ Key Differences

| Feature                 | ⏱️ Time Series                                             | 📌 Timestamped Data                                   |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dependency**          | Values depend on past/future observations                  | Events are independent                                |
| **Goal**                | Find patterns & forecast future                            | Log, monitor, or analyze events                       |
| **Examples**            | Demand forecasting, price prediction, renewable generation | Smart meter logs, equipment alerts, anomaly detection |
| **Feature Engineering** | Lags, rolling averages, seasonality                        | Extract time of day, day of week, event flags         |

## ⚡ Energy Examples

### Time Series

* 🔋 **Electricity demand forecasting**: demand rises in summer (AC) and falls at night.
* 🌞 **Solar/wind generation**: output depends on past radiation/wind speeds.
* 💶 **Energy price prediction**: past fluctuations + demand/weather affect future prices.

### Timestamped Data

* 🏠 **Smart meter logs**: records consumption every minute (discrete events).
* 🏭 **Machine logs**: when appliances or machines consumed power.
* 🚨 **Event alerts**: sensor detects overheating in a transformer (logged with timestamp).

## ✅ Summary

* ⏱️ **Time Series** = continuous, dependent data over time → used for **forecasting**.
* 📌 **Timestamped Data** = events with a time tag → used for **logging, monitoring, anomalies**.
* 🧩 Timestamped data **can become time series** if aggregated or structured into a sequence (e.g., hourly totals from smart meters).
