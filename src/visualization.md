# 👀 Visualisation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of **understanding data before modeling**.
While statistics (like `.describe()`) give summaries, **visualizations reveal patterns, trends, and anomalies** that numbers alone can hide.

### 🔎 Why visuals matter in EDA

* 📈 **Detect patterns** → daily cycles, weekly seasonality, long-term trends.
* 🚩 **Spot anomalies** → missing data, sudden spikes, holidays that break the routine.
* 📊 **Compare distributions** → e.g., winter vs summer demand, weekdays vs weekends.
* 🔗 **Reveal relationships** → demand vs temperature, demand vs wind speed.
* 🎨 **Communicate insights** → a good chart explains data more clearly than a table of numbers.

### ⚡ Energy Example

* A **line plot** shows the daily load curve and peak hours.
* A **histogram** reveals the typical range of demand values.
* A **scatterplot** with temperature highlights the U-shaped demand relationship (heating & cooling).
* A **heatmap** of correlations shows which weather variables impact demand most.

👉 In EDA, visuals are not just “pretty pictures” — they are **analytical tools** that guide decisions about data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling.
