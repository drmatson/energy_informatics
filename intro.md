# ðŸ“– Data Science for the Digital Energy Sector

This course explores how **data science** supports the **digital transformation of the energy sector**. Students will follow the **data science lifecycle**, from cleaning and feature engineering to visualization and interpretation of energy datasets.

A strong focus is placed on **time series analysis**, introducing both **statistical models** and **machine learning methods** for energy forecasting. Students will learn to build models with external inputs (e.g., weather, prices) and apply them to **forecast demand and production**.

The course concludes with **optimal control of energy storage systems**, showing how forecasts can be turned into actionable decisions for efficient and sustainable energy management.
