# 🐍 Python/Numpy/Pandas

This chapter introduces two of the most important Python libraries for **data science and  analytics**: **NumPy** and **Pandas**. Together, they provide the foundation for efficient data storage, manipulation, and analysis.

* **NumPy** offers fast, memory-efficient arrays and mathematical functions, enabling operations on large numerical datasets without the overhead of Python loops. We explore array creation, indexing, broadcasting, reshaping, aggregation, random number generation, and linear algebra — all illustrated with **examples**.

* **Pandas** builds on NumPy to provide high-level data structures: **Series** (1D) and **DataFrames** (2D). It makes working with real-world, tabular datasets intuitive. We cover inspection, selection (rows & columns), filtering, derived columns, groupby and aggregations, joins and merges, reshaping, missing data handling, categoricals, time series, and input/output. 


👉 Together, NumPy and Pandas form the **core toolkit for modern data analysis in Python**, preparing learners for deeper topics in machine learning, statistics, and domain-specific energy applications.
